        <h1>Travel to ....</h1>
        <h2>Beautiful Grand Cayman!</h2>
        <p>Grand Cayman is the largest of the Cayman Islands, a British Overseas Territory in the Caribbean. George Town, its capital, is home to the Cayman Islands National Museum, dedicated to Caymanian heritage. The city is also a major cruise-ship port and site of the ruins of colonial-era Fort George. Beaches and vibrant coral reefs are the island’s hallmarks. ― Google

    <p>And don't forget shopping!
Did you know that there is no additional tax on any of your purchases?! And I mean <strong>ANY </strong> of your purchases! So, if you had your eye on that special piece of luxury jewelry<em> *wink,wink*</em>, you may want to save that purchase for this trip! Among other luxury retailers like 
       <ol>
       <li>Gucci
       <li>Cartier 
       <li>Tiffany & Co.
       </ol> 
       you will find many fine jewelry stores along the <em>West End</em> waterfront where the cruiseships dock. My favorite has been relocated to a nearby mall called <em>Caymana Bay</em>.There, you will find many name brand jewelers all under one roof at discounted prices compared to those you will find stateside. Trust me, you will not be dissapointed!  </p>
